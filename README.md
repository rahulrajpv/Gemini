Welcome to the beginner's guide to using the Gemini AI API in Python! This guide will help you tap into Google's powerful Gemini large language models, enabling you to create intelligent applications that understand both text and images. With step-by-step instructions, you'll learn how to set up your development environment, access the API, and generate text responses from various inputs.


## Installation

To get started, you'll need to install the Python SDK for the Gemini API. It's conveniently packaged in the [`google-generativeai`](https://pypi.org/project/google-generativeai/) package. Use pip to install the dependency:

```bash
pip install -q -U google-generativeai
```

## Getting Started

### API Key Setup

Before you can use the Gemini API, you'll need an API key. You can obtain one easily by visiting the [API Key Generation Page](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey). Once you have your key, you can set it up in two ways:

1. **Environment Variable**: Put your API key in the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable.
2. **Pass Key to SDK**: Use `genai.configure(api_key=YOUR_API_KEY)` to pass your API key to the SDK.

```python
import google.generativeai as genai

# Option 1: Use an environment variable
GOOGLE_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
os.environ['GOOGLE_API_KEY'] = GOOGLE_API_KEY

# Option 2: Pass key to SDK
genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
```

### Choose Your Model

You can select the appropriate Gemini model for your needs:

- `gemini-pro`: Optimized for text-only prompts.
- `gemini-pro-vision`: Optimized for text-and-images prompts.

```python
# Example: Select the gemini-pro model
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')
```

### Generate Text from Text Inputs

For text-only prompts, use the `generate_content` method with the `gemini-pro` model:

```python
response = model.generate_content("What is the Gemini.AI?")
```

### Response Formatting

You can access the response text using `response.text`. To display it in Markdown format, use the `to_markdown` function:

```python
from IPython.display import Markdown
from IPython.display import display

display(Markdown(response.text))
```

### Generate Text from Image and Text Inputs

Gemini's `gemini-pro-vision` model can handle multimodal prompts. To include an image, use the `generate_content` method:

```python
import PIL.Image

image = PIL.Image.open('image.jpg')
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro-vision')
response = model.generate_content(image)
```

### Multimodal Prompts

You can pass both text and images in a prompt by using a list:

```python
response = model.generate_content(["Write a short description", image], stream=True)
response.resolve()
```
